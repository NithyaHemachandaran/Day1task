1)Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are:

HTTP/1.1

1.It works on the textual format.
2.There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests
 behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
3.It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
4.It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2:

1.It works on the binary protocol.
2.It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
3.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
4.It uses HPACK for data compression.


2)Objects and Its Internal Representation in JavaScript:

1)Objects,
 in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for 
modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive 
data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) 
in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

2)Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data,
 of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables 
or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

3)An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties.
 A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”),
 and the value can be anything.

4)JavaScript Object Properties:
 The property names can be strings or numbers.
 In case the property names are numbers, they must be accessed using the 
“bracket notation” like this.
